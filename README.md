This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

`npm install` to install dependencies (there's a lot because bootstrap)


`npm start` to run 


`npm run build` to concat everything


Added SASS preprocessor, so run `npm run watch-css` in same directory



This is a simple build with React testing API fetching
